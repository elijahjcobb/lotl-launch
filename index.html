		<p class="description">"The Lesson of the Lark" – a new concert work celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the ratification of Women’s Voting Rights. This piece, which is meant to uplift and unify us during these challenging times, is a multi-movement work composed for narrator, soprano and mezzo-soprano soloists, chorus, and jazz orchestra. The work takes its inspiration from the language of Jazz, including elements of Swing, Blues, Bossa Nova, Gospel, Salsa, and improvisation.</p>
